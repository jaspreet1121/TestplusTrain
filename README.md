TestplusTrain
It combines the two data sets of test data and training data by Samsun Galaxy phone.
We take the test and train datasets, we give the column names to both the sets by activity_labels.txt file.
We subset the columns with mean and standard deviation values.
We convert label datasets to the activity datasets.
We add subject number column and activity position column to the corresponding datasets.
Finally we bind the train and test sets.
And write the dataframe to result.txt file.
